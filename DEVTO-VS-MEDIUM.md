## 🎯 Which Platform Should You Choose?

### Choose DEV.to if:

- ✅ You write technical content for developers
- ✅ You want reliable automation
- ✅ You need API features (cover images, updates)
- ✅ You want to build in a developer community
- ✅ You prefer free, open platforms
- ✅ You want to post code-heavy tutorials

### Choose Medium if:

- ✅ You write for general tech audience
- ✅ You want monetization opportunities
- ✅ You prioritize SEO/domain authority
- ✅ You don’t need automation (manual posting is fine)
- ✅ You write thought leadership/opinion pieces
- ✅ Your audience is already on Medium

### Why Not Both? 🤔

You CAN cross-post to both! Use `canonical_url` to avoid duplicate content penalties.

## 🔄 Migration from Medium to DEV.to

### Option 1: Fresh Start on DEV.to

**Recommended for:**

- New writers
- Those with few Medium articles
- Starting a new technical focus

**Steps:**

1. Set up DEV.to automation (see DEVTO-SETUP-GUIDE.md)
1. Start writing new content on DEV.to
1. Keep Medium articles as-is (for SEO benefit)

### Option 2: Import Existing Medium Articles

**Recommended for:**

- Established Medium writers

1. **Convert Medium HTML to Markdown:**
   
   ```bash
   # Use Pandoc or online converters
   pandoc medium-article.html -o article.md
   ```
1. **Update Frontmatter:**
   
   ```yaml
   ---
   title: "Original Title"
   published: false
   description: "Add description"
   tags: ["tag1", "tag2"]
   canonical_url: "https://medium.com/your-original-article"
   ---
   ```
1. **Push to GitHub:**
   
   ```bash
   git add articles/imported-article.md
   git commit -m "Import from Medium"

   ```

### Option 3: Cross-Post Everything

**Recommended for:**

- Maximum reach
- SEO benefits from both platforms
- Writers with time to manage both

**Workflow:**

1. Write in your repository

**Or reverse:**

1. Publish to Medium first
1. Publish to DEV.to with `canonical_url` pointing to Medium

## 🔄 Setting Up Cross-Posting

### DEV.to as Primary (Recommended)

**Why DEV.to first:**

- Better API automation
- More reliable
- Easier workflow

**Frontmatter:**

```yaml
---
title: "Your Article"
published: true
# No canonical_url - DEV.to is the original
---
```

**On Medium:**

```yaml
---
title: "Your Article"
canonical_url: "https://dev.to/yourusername/your-article"
---
```

### Medium as Primary

**Why Medium first:**

- Better SEO/domain authority
- Monetization opportunities
- Broader audience

**On Medium:**

- Publish normally (no canonical URL)

**On DEV.to:**

```yaml
---
title: "Your Article"
canonical_url: "https://medium.com/@you/your-article"
---
```

## 🛠️ Converting Between Formats

### Medium to DEV.to Frontmatter

**Medium format:**

```yaml
---
title: "Article Title"
tags: ["tag1", "tag2", "tag3"]
publish_status: "draft"
canonical_url: ""
notify_followers: false
---
```

**DEV.to format:**

```yaml
---
title: "Article Title"
published: false
tags: ["tag1", "tag2", "tag3", "tag4"]
series: ""
canonical_url: ""
cover_image: ""
description: ""
---
```

### Automated Conversion Script

```python
import frontmatter

def convert_medium_to_devto(medium_file, devto_file):
    """Convert Medium article format to DEV.to format."""
    with open(medium_file, 'r') as f:
        post = frontmatter.load(f)
    
    # Convert metadata
    new_meta = {
        'title': post.get('title'),
        'published': post.get('publish_status') != 'draft',
        'description': post.get('description', ''),
        'tags': post.get('tags', []),
        'canonical_url': post.get('canonical_url', ''),
        'cover_image': '',
        'series': ''
    }
    
    # Create new post
    new_post = frontmatter.Post(post.content, **new_meta)
    
    # Write to file
    with open(devto_file, 'w') as f:
        f.write(frontmatter.dumps(new_post))

# Usage
convert_medium_to_devto('articles/medium-article.md', 'articles/devto-article.md')
```
